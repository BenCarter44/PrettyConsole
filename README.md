# PrettyConsole

This library is similar to `libcurses` in that it allows for manipulation of "graphics" on a console.

The API of PrettyConsole is similar to java.awt and Rectangle2D and the like.

One can "post" shapes to a canvas, and then render the canvas onto a console.


# To build:

Does a clean build:

- Run `build.bat` inside a Developer Command Prompt in Windows
- gitRun `build.sh` in a linux box. 

Calls cmake in the backend.
